%%%  Simplified C1 on reading formula in, to give:
     %%%  C1:  true
***  Proved C1:  true
-S-  Applied substitution rule init_rules(7).
     This was achieved by replacing all occurrences of measures__joules__first 
          by:
          0.
<S>  New C2:  0 <= measures__joules__last
-S-  Applied substitution rule init_rules(8).
     This was achieved by replacing all occurrences of measures__joules__last
